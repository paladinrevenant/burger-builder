# Burger Builder

## Description
This app allows the user to build a customized burger. The app calculates the price of the burger automatically. Once the user is satisfied with their burger, they may checkout and they are presented with a summary of the ingredients on their customized burger.

## Design Notes
In the current iteration of the project, it may seem odd that the backdrop and the order summary are controlled in two separate contexts. This was done, because I believe that the backdrop will eventually be triggered in places other than with ordering. If this ends up not being the case, then I will probably refactor it.

## Other Notes
This project is being developed as part of Maximilian Schwarzmuller's course "React - The Complete Guide" on Udemy. Once I have finished with that course, I will continue to make changes to this project to make it my own.
